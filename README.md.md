## üìã Overview

CP-Planta is a comprehensive web application for optimizing and managing production processes in a hygienized food plant. The system enables efficient tracking of raw materials, production stages, and quality control in compliance with industry standards.

This project is developed by the AGES (Ag√™ncia Experimental de Engenharia de Software) team for Hortti Tech as part of the AGES III course at PUCRS.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

The CP-Planta application follows a modern microservices architecture, deployed using infrastructure as code principles on multiple cloud platforms.

### Key Components

- **Frontend**: React.js application with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: NestJS API with Prisma ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with primary-replica replication
- **Infrastructure**: Multi-cloud deployment supporting AWS and Azure
- **Orchestration**: Docker Swarm for container management

### Deployment Workflow

Our deployment process is fully automated, allowing for consistent, repeatable deployments across cloud providers:

### Database Architecture

The database layer implements high availability through PostgreSQL replication:

## üõ†Ô∏è Repository Structure

This repository serves as the root project, containing all CP-Planta components as submodules:

- [**AGES-III-CP-Planta-Frontend**](https://github.com/Saccilotto-AGES-Projects/AGES-III-CP-Planta-Frontend): React.js frontend application
- [**AGES-III-CP-Planta-Backend**](https://github.com/Saccilotto-AGES-Projects/AGES-III-CP-Planta-Backend): NestJS backend API
- [**AGES-III-CP-Planta-Infra**](https://github.com/Saccilotto-AGES-Projects/AGES-III-CP-Planta-Infra): Infrastructure as Code and deployment scripts

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Docker and Docker Compose (for local development)
- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- Terraform and Ansible (for production deployment)

### Clone with Submodules

```bash
# Clone the main repository with all submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Saccilotto-AGES-Projects/AGES-III-CP-Planta.git

# Navigate to the project folder
cd AGES-III-CP-Planta
```

### Local Development

```bash
# Start all services locally with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Access the services
Frontend: http://localhost:3001
Backend API: http://localhost:3000
PgAdmin: http://localhost:5050
```

### Production Deployment

For complete deployment instructions, see the [Infrastructure Documentation](https://github.com/Saccilotto-AGES-Projects/AGES-III-CP-Planta-Infra/blob/main/README.md).

Quick deployment steps:

```bash
# Navigate to the infrastructure folder
cd AGES-III-CP-Planta-Infra

# Configure your environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your cloud provider credentials

# Deploy to AWS (default)
./deploy.sh --provider aws

# Or deploy to Azure
./deploy.sh --provider azure
```

## üìä Project Features

The CP-Planta system provides the following key capabilities:

- **Raw Material Management**: Track incoming materials and inventory
- **Production Planning**: Schedule and monitor production orders
- **Process Control**: Record and visualize production stages
- **Quality Assurance**: Document inspections and quality issues
- **Traceability**: Complete history for each batch from raw materials to final product
- **Inventory Control**: Manage stock levels of raw materials and finished products
